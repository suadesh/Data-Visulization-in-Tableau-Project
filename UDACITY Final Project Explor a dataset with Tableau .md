## Summary: 

This data set use in this project is one of the dataset proposed by Udacity. it contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
One of the most interesting feature in this dataset is the *loan status*, that shows if the loan has been repaid or not. I mostly focus my attention to this features, looking for other features around it.
As shows at the beginning of the tableau work, __83,14%__ of the loans are completed, current or in the final payment stage. __15,04%__ are charged-off or defaulted while __1,82%__ are pas-due and around __0%__ are cancelled. 
The loans informations are from _2005_ to _2014_, and the more than __50%__ of the loans are from the last 3 of these years.
